    <b><p>This book was about Indian civilization, culture and life.<br>
        She saw only sheer ignorance and filth in India and nothing good or decent.<br>
        People who were opposed to the freedom of India had given money for the publication of Miss Mayo's book.<br>
        In response to that book Lala Lajpat Rai wrote this book.
